# America's Political Reesponse to Communsim
The United States wavered between maintaing neutrality or becoming entrenched in global affairs, which excaberated the tensions between isolationism and internationalism. Paul Nitze, author of "NSC 68: 'United States Objectives and Programs for National Security," argued that America should "affirm the necessity of their positive participation in the global community" (Nitize 14). This idea suggested that the United States should position itself as a world leader if it wanted to unite its allies against communism (Nitze 14).

## Introduction

Here's some sample text, written in Markdown.
In Markdown, any text with no empty lines between will become a paragraph.

Leave an empty line between headings and paragraphs.

Font can be *Italic* or **Bold**.

Citing your work is important! [^1]

Title sections of your essay with headings, by adding a pound sign (`#`) in front of the title:

# Heading One

## Heading Two

### Heading Three, etc.

Hyperlinks look like this [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/).

A bullet list is created using `*`, `+`, or `-`, like:

- muffin

A numbered list is created using a number + `.`, like:

1. one
2. two
6. three
2. four

A horizontal line break can be useful for separating content:
