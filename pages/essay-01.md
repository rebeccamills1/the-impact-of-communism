## Introduction

Prior to World War II, Americans viewed communism as both a solution to the problems of capitalism and a threat that clashed with U.S. values. The United States Senate and others recognized that America should spread democracy abroad to counteract the influence of communism. However, others, such as *The Daily Worker*, argued that communism instituted a system of worker equality and allowed them to shake off the chains of capitalist control. These tensions exacerbated conflicts between American communists and anticommunists. During 1900-1945, the United States developed a strained relationship with communism, centered around tensions between the communist, socialist and anti-communist movements, which culminated in the start of the Cold War.[^1]

### Origin and Impact of the Socialist Movement

During the Progressive Era, the socialist movement in the United States positioned itself as a champion of worker reforms that sought to remedy the problems of capitalism, which demonstrated capital-labor conflicts. Beginning in 1898, labor activists viewed the industrialization and corruption of the Gilded Age as catalysts for social and economic inequality in the U.S. This inequality facilitated the founding of the Social Democratic Party and the Socialist Labor Party in 1901, who argued that America’s problems stemmed from “two distinct classes with conflicting interests.” This idea framed capitalism as a conflict between those who controlled the product of labor and laborers. Because of this conflict, socialists, such as Eugene V. Debs, campaigned for reforms, such as referendums and communal economic control, that sought to solidify government control over economic life in the U.S. and expand the political power of the people. William Mailly, National Secretary of the Socialist Party, reinforced this notion when he asserted that socialists should “combine democracy in management, efficiency in action and economy in labor and expense” to achieve their goals. He suggested that Americans should elect socialist candidates and use democratic means to enact reforms that benefited workers.[^2]. The Socialist Labor Party provided Americans with real opportunities to use the government to solve some of their most pressing problems.[^3]

### The Decline of the Socialist Movement and Rise of the Communist Party During World War I 

During World War I, the socialist movement stifled dissent when they promoted a unified anti-war response, which laid the foundation for divisions within the movement. Beginning in 1918, Eugene V. Debs denounced U.S. involvement in the war and argued that “[the master class] has trained [the working class] to believe it to be [their] patriotic duty to go to war.” This belief framed World War I as another capitalist venture imposed upon the working class, which became the basis of the Socialist Labor Party’s anti-war platform. Because of this opposition, some socialists resisted all policies that required them to support the war effort, such as enlisting in the draft. However, while the Socialist Labor Party formally criticized war, John Spargo, a member of the National Committee of the Socialist Party, recognized that all Americas should contribute to the war effort. Spargo’s pro-war position demonstrated that some party members remained loyal to their country and broke away from the Socialist Labor Party. This lack of tolerance for opposing ideals set the socialist movement on a collision course toward disunification.[^4]
