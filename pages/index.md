# The Effects of Communism and Anti-Communism on 20th Century American Politics

The United States developed a contentious relationship with communism and socialism, which exacerbated tensions between the communist and anti-communist movements. Senator Lee Overman and others argued that America should spread democracy and freedom abroad to counteract communism’s influence. Others, such as Eugene V. Debs, claimed that communism promoted worker equality and eliminated capitalist corruption and inequality. This multimedia essay traces the evolution of communism, socialism, and anti-communism in the United States and explores how these ideologies shaped America’s political policies.
